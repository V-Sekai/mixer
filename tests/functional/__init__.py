"""
Functional tests for Mixer synchronization.

This package provides comprehensive integration tests for core Mixer functionality,
focusing on real user workflows like joining rooms, creating objects, and collaborating.

Tests in this directory use real Blender instances and verify that synchronization
works end-to-end across multiple users in both Generic and VRtist protocols.
